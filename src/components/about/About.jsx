                Hi, I'm <span>Jonny</span>
              </h3>
              <p>I'm a photographer based out of Kelowna, BC.</p>
              <p>
                I was born in Ontario but grew up in the Lower
                Mainland/Okanagan. I love Kelowna, the amazing
                wineries/breweries we have here and of course the weather, minus
                the fire and smoke season! I am a father of one amazing son
                Henry and I have a beautiful wife Kristina. We have an old dog
                Thor, who is literally the grumpiest dog on the planet but I
                love him! We also have 2 cats; Lola (who needs a diet) and Lucy.
                Needless to say, it's a very busy household!
              </p>
              <p>
                <br></br>
                Iâ€™m definitely more on the goofy side. I have a great sense of
                humour and I love making people laugh. I love kids and meeting
                new people. I find it very easy to make people comfortable in
                front of my camera!
              </p>
              <p>
                <br></br>I love to photograph weddings! From getting ready, to
                the first dance. The whole event is such an amazing experience
                to be apart of! I love doing engagement shoots, family sessions,
                and everything else in between! I really enjoying getting
                creative by incorporating new and exciting techniques, and any
                ideas you or I may have to capture your special moments!
              </p>
              <br></br>
              <p>
                I would love to chat with you if your interested in booking with
                me! Let's make it happen!
