                Hi, I'm <span>Jonny</span>
              </h3>
              <p>
                I'm a lifestyle photographer based out of Kelowna, BC.
                <br></br>
                Iâ€™ve been passionate about photography for over 7 years, but
                this last year I decided I wanted to work towards doing this
                thing I love full time.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>I <strong>LOVE</strong> that you are always learning no
                matter how long you have been doing it!
                <br></br>I <strong>LOVE</strong> doing landscape/cityscape
                photography! It keeps me inspired to keep pushing my creative
                boundaries!
                <br></br>I <strong>LOVE</strong> the photography community!
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The support - both online, and in my city - has been amazing,
                and there are so many unbelievable creators that always keep me
                motivated to get out and take pictures and stand out!
