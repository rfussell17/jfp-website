You have to understand, we are NOT comfortable in front of a camera: we're incredibly awkward, never know what to do with our hands or how to stand, and that awkwardness can easily come through in photos. Jonny made the experience SO comfortable and had us laughing the whole time! His prompts were clear and fun, and still got gorgeous candid photos as well. He was able to somehow make us look pretty while still capturing who we are as a couple, and that's something.`,

He gave us a whole day away from his wife and newborn on boxing day which was nothing short of amazing. The photos were spectacular, even though we had a winter wedding in low light and -25 weather. He even stayed outside all day so his lenses wouldn't fog up and he would be ready at a moments notice. If you are looking for a wedding photographer, Jonny is your guy!`,

He made two people who hate having their picture taken feel completely comfortable, and captured some really special candid photos of us, our family and friends will cherish for the rest of our lives. Jonny was an absolute blast to have with us on our wedding day, and fit right in with the celebration. He was full of great ideas and was so enthusiastic, and an excellent communicator. We couldn't be happier to have had Jonny capture our special day, and have recommended him to everyone we know. We will absolutely be using his services again in the future.`,
